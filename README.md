### **🚀 One-Liner**

Inha Connect brings events, clubs, mentorship, and student services together in a single modern platform for a more connected campus experience.

---

### **🎯 Problem Statement**

Students often struggle to find relevant events, discover active clubs, connect with alumni, and access campus resources because information is scattered across social media, emails, and posters. This fragmentation reduces engagement and leaves many opportunities unnoticed.

### **💡 Proposed Solution**

Inha Connect provides a centralized, intuitive hub that makes it easy for students to discover events, explore clubs, connect with mentors, and access peer-to-peer services. Moreover, admins get powerful dashboards and analytics to manage communities effectively.
